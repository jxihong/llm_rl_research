The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing!", "I feel a know a good bit about charities. I am disappointed in the salaries of the CEO, Executive VP & VP. I think a half million dollars that the CEO is compensated is a bit much. These dollars could be used to help more children.

For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.", "I agree that a qualified person is needed to run such a charity. I think my biggest concern when salaries get so high they lose focus of what the organization is needing to do. We all like money!

There are so many children charities that you really have to study each one to be able to decide who you would want to make your donation to. Are you a donor of Save the Children charity?", "Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area.

Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?", "I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.", "I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?", "yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.", "It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?", "I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.", "I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?", "Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. ", "I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? ", "Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.", "I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  ", "I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.", "I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?", "Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything. Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child. ", "I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time", "Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to. I have seen a lot of people do the same. I think some people will say \"maybe next time\" if they aren\\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\\'t have the funds to do so.

I changed to a Vegan diet due to a Cancer risk as well, every woman but me in my family has had some type of cancer. I actually have converted my elderly mother to a Vegan diet over the last year, she's doing great!", "Wow that's really great to hear! My parents won't go vegan or vegetarian themselves but have definitely started making healthier choices since I went vegan. I guess every little effort helps, right?

Can I ask how you first heard about Save the Children?", "I think it was on television.  They did a like a 30 minute show to bring awareness to the Charity.  They are a very good charity.  I'm not able to conceive a child so I would love helping other people children in need.", "Wow yeah, that's a really great way to pay it forward if you aren't able to have kids yourself.

I thought it was fun but wouldn't do anything productive. Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help.", "Oh wow, I never knew that! That is amazing what a difference we can make without thinking it would really make one", "I know and besides it got my son to dump a bucket of ice water on himself which was just hilarious.", "That is funny! Honestly, before the challenge I never even heard about ALS, so I guess it did its job by spreading awareness", "That's really true. Maybe on top of people not wanting the rigamarole of the donation process sometimes all we need is a better understanding of the need or just faith that a little from everyone can go a long way.

This HIT we are doing is kind of doing the same thing as that other survey I did. We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away.

But how can I make sure my donation, even if small, will be used effectively?", "That's a great question! For example, if you donate around $1, it can provide a healthy meal to a child in need. Even the smallest donations make a huge difference because Save the Children pools donations to make a larger impact.", "Now it makes more sense. I believe in the concept of giving, so I'd be really pleased to make a contribution. How do I proceed?", "That's wonderful! You can go to the Save the Children website and click on the donate button. The procedure is straightforward, and you can use a debit or credit card for your donation.", "Ok, let me check out the website.", "Sure, take your time. And remember, no donation is too small. Even a dollar can make a significant difference.", "Alright, I've made my donation just now.", "That's amazing! On behalf of Save The Children, we truly appreciate your donation.

I am checking out their website and they look like a great organization. Much of the funds donated go to help children dealing in the war torn violence of Syria.", "Oh right, that's terrible... The situation in Syria is truly heartbreaking. But you know what? There are plenty of causes to donate to. Why should I choose this one over others?", "That's true, there are many causes that need assistance. Save The Children does important work globally, but specifically in Syria, they're providing food, clean water, education, and protection to children. They're looking to rebuild lives shattered by conflict. Your donation can definitely make a significant difference.", "Hmm... I see your point. How do they ensure the donation reaches the right place and really helps those it's intended for?", "That is a very valid concern. Transparency and accountability are central at Save The Children. They work directly on the ground as well as with local partners to maximize the impact. Plus, they provide regular updates about their programs and how effectively the donations are used.", "That sounds responsible. But still, we hear so many stories about misuse of funds. It's hard to trust.", "I understand your apprehension. However, the charity has been vetted by multiple independent organizations, and it continually receives high scores for accountability and transparency. I recommend checking their annual reports for a detailed account on their spending.", "Alright, I'll definitely do that. Is there a minimum amount I should donate?", "No, every amount helps! A small contribution might seem insignificant, but when combined with donations from others, it can bring about significant change. You may donate any amount that you are comfortable with.", "Hmm...you do make a persuasive argument. Alright, let me make a small donation for now and see how that goes.", "Wonderful, thank you!

It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.

This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you?", "Yes, I definitely understand you. It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country", "I know it is crazy. Sometimes I think about the little things I buy. Like yesterday I had a craving for candy so I bought a bag of smarties for $2.79. Sometimes I wonder how much it could help someone else instead of just satisfying my cravings.", "Yes, I see what you're saying. Sometimes we can overlook the impact of small, unnecessary purchases, especially when they could be put to better use elsewhere.", "That's exactly what I mean! It's not about making huge sacrifices, but more about utilizing resources better. Would you consider donating even a small amount to help these children?", "Eh, I'm just not sure. Money's tight as it is, you know.", "Of course, I understand. Every penny counts in our personal budgets, but also every penny can make a difference in the lives of these children.

Still, you're talking about a reoccurring donation.", "I totally understand your concern, but you could also think of it as a one-time donation, like the price of a coffee you might have today. It could be as little as $2. How does that sound?", "Well, when you put it that way... it doesn't seem like so much.", "Right, it\u2019s about perspective. Every little bit helps, and you'll make a real, tangible difference in a child's life. So, shall we proceed with the $2 donation?", "You really know how to make a point. Let's do that.
