Is there any countries that they focus?","Syria, Thousands of kids die in just a quarter of a year over there and you could help save them with just some pocket change.","Where is the organisation's headquarters?","London, United Kingdom. If you care about children, even a little bit, then you should be outraged and willing to help make an impact","I get mails and calls from different charities. I just want to make sure that this one is genuine ","You don't have to take my word for it, you can check them out at  URL  they have helped countless children around the globe, their credential are Impeccable!","Thanks for the web-page link. I checked it and it looks genuine.","I'm sure you've made some frivolous purchases, we all have. I'm only asking for you to pick the kids today. Every bit counts.","How can I donate to the organisation?","You can donate right through the website I provided a link for, in the top left corner there is a red donate button.","Thanks for the info.

You should feel proud.","will I get a confirmation mail after the donation?","Yes, it will also include a subscription that you can opt out of, but will show your dollars at work and keep you informed on what you contributed to.","What is this subscription about?","It's a Save The Children eNews letter that provides breaking emergency alerts and updates on what your money helped with.","Okay. Is this donation tax deductible?","These contributions are tax-deductible in the US. Thanks again for choosing to help the children."],"reward":0.0},{"conversation":["Hi, have you ever heard of the charity \"Save the Children\" before?","No I havent, please tell me more.","Save the Children is a charity organization that provides funding to help get children access to health and education all over the world  ","That sounds great.  I think any childrens charity that is legitimate is worthy.  I am a big fan of St Jude's, I like the fact that they treat children but are also looking for a cure for diseases.","Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that","So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?","Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  ","I feel so silly! Is \"Save the Children\" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching","Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.","Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough","Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.","Thats great, what is their website so I can look more into it?"," URL here you go","Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?","I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club","oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.","Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed","Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.","I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack. ","That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing this with me, I will definitely look more into this charity!","Great happy to help! Thanks for a nice conversation"],"reward":0.0},{"conversation":["hi","Hi, would you donate to a children's charity?","you would like to donate to a children's charity?","Yes I would love to donate to a children's charity.

What they need is to be extracted from those countries so that they can have a better life not 0.25.","Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge.

I am looking to raise money for the charity Save the Children and I was wondering if you might beinterested?","I have been reading articles about Save the Children charity and I find them quite interesting.","They are a really good charity. For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations.","I think this is quite interesting. I have read that 86% of the funds raised go directly to benefiting the children. I also think it is very interesting that a woman is President & CEO. I think this is great because not to often are woman CEO's. This speaks volumes in my opinion to the donors.","You are correct. The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing!","I feel a know a good bit about charities. I am disappointed in the salaries of the CEO, Executive VP & VP. I think a half million dollars that the CEO is compensated is a bit much. These dollars could be used to help more children. ","You won't hear me argue with that, but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.","I agree that a qualified person is needed to run such a charity. I think my biggest concern when salaries get so high they lose focus of what the organization is needing to do. We all like money! I think that this organization is a very good organization and have competent people running it. There are so many children charities that you really have to study each one to be able to decide who you would want to make your donation to. Are you a donor of Save the Children charity?","Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others! ","Absolutely true of Save the Children. I always look at how many children have been helped and what they help the children with. I then look at the overall salaries of the organization (petty maybe) but I need to make sure in my heart that the money I donate is going to help children not the management, even though I know a portion goes to them. I am willing to make a donation to the great cause.","If it helps you, Charity Navigator gives them 3 out of 4 stars. As you probably know there are very few charities that have a 4 star rating. This is mainly due to overhead costs of the charities. That being said, you can be assured your money will be doing a lot of good in the world!","Absolutely. I use Charity Navigator when I decide to make donations. I think it is important for people to look at this when making a decision to donate to any organization.","I think that is very wise to do. Even if you are making a small donation, you want to be sure that it is being used to its fullest potential.","Yes. I think this is where some people are lacking in making donations to organizations who don't benefit the greater good. Knowledge is a key factor.","It is a shame that we live in a world where this is an issue, but I think if you make a donation to Save the Children, you can be assured your money will be used to the fullest extent.","I agree. I will be making a donation to Save the Children organization.","How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

There are a lot of kids out there who really need all the help they can get, and even just some of your payment for this task could be a huge help to them.","I really don't have any extra cash to just throw away in a charity. Every little bit I make on this site helps.","You're not throwing it away though.  You're helping to make sure children get enough food to survive, as well as getting them access to healthcare and education.

Would you really notice 5 cents going to charity instead of yourself?","Yeah I don't really care that much about the children or their families. If it was a friend or a family member that needed financial assistance I'd help but not some random poor family.","You can actually go to the website and pick a specific child to help, and even focus on helping a child closer to home.  Might make you feel more connected to these kids.","That's not enough for me honestly. A picture and a profile isn't enough for me to think about giving away some of my reward.","How would you feel if you were the one in need and someone said that about you?  a few cents is negligible to you, but it can do a world of good for these children.","I'd be understanding because everyone's lives are different and you can't always imagine what their current situation is just by looking at them. If I was in need I would be perfectly fine with not bieng donated to because they worked for their money so it's up to them to decide what they do with it.","But you won't be understanding that there are children suffering and even the slightest bit of help from you would do a world of good for them?","I do understand that I could donate and possibly help suffering families.

Most people's problems with charities is they can never understand how the money is used, if it's used efficiently, how they're trustworthy, etc. It's hard enough to have money to donate, so people want to make sure that, if they do, it's actually making a difference.","Right.

I feel like we can have more of a direct impact on something. Do you know of any charities like that?","Unfortunately no. However, the charity does in fact help the children access basic necessities such as food and water to those impacted by natural disasters across the globe. So while not directly helping families financially they are relieving some burdens.","Okay, I'm already familiar with Save the Children, I just typically have concerns on where the money actually goes with them. But how much are you thinking we should donate?","Any amount will do, however it'll be extracted from the task payment. I'd say .15 cents from both of us should be fair. Also my mistake earlier, Save the Children apparently has had a childhood cancer treatment going on for a few years now.","Okay, I think .15 cents sounds fair.

It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, and works in developing countries like Cambodia to helpsupport the children. ","No I have not. Can you tell me more about this organization?","Yeah absolutely! It's not a government organization, so in my opinion the funds are better spent than being wasted in the typical bureaucratic red tape and wasteful expenditures. This means that it's reliant on donations from the public though! They also provide relief for extremely vulnerable children. In addition to money and food relief that they provide, they also offer access to health and education that they otherwise would not. ","I see. What is your role with this charity?","Oh none, just a supporter. I'm a single mother, so any Good organizations hit close to home. Do you think this sounds like an organization you'd support?","Oh I see. If I were to donate, how would I pay?","Well actually you could donate without actually having to pay! Mturk is giving us a bonus, and we can choose to donate part of it right through Mturk! I think this is awesome, because too many organizations just care about getting the results that they're looking for (research). But at least this one is also doing some social good as well! Do you think you'd donate just $1 if it was given through Mturk like I mentioned?","That's really awesome! Yeah $1 sounds good to me but I don't know if this amount would be impactful as you mentioned a few conversations ago.","That's not true, every penny counts! And in other countries, money can go a lot farther. Just because of your $1, there's now a child that won't have to go without food today or tomorrow :) You should feel good about your contribution!","You're right! I guess I need to start donating more often too. And yes, I'll donate my $1.","Thank you! I can relate though, I often feel like I'm not doing enough.

My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.  SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.  I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!","I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.  I hope you have success  in your field. I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.  I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.","I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.  They are the weak ones in my eyes.","I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do? I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment. Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.","I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.  I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.","If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.  So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.  You want to match all our payment to Save the Children? Would that be okay? Or should we lock in your half payment?","I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.  I would lock into half.","Sure let's do it. I might donate a little more I don't know how to do that but, I think they deserve it, I'm convince by talking to you that people regardless of how they feel about refugees that they can still care about kids. ","I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!","Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.  I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.  But you're right it's a whole generation, that's A LOT of people.  I always forget that kids turn into adults, i mean not that part, but the whole part where they are all apart of the community! :)","Thanks for talking me thru this today!

I work with children primarily from underprivileged families or no families at all.","That is wonderful, whenever there are charity events or donations being taken. I always donate if it is for children causes. What about you?","I do the same but also get involved regularly.  Today, for instance, is our End of Summer Carnival for the kids.  Its one of our largest fundraisers of the year.","Wow, that sounds really fun. Time and money donations are really two important aspects for charities. Without the funding, it would not be able to continue and without volunteers, no one can do the actual work.  ","I know this may seem a bit forward and I do apologize as I do not mean to offend.  Given your love for children and your work, would you be willing to donate a small amount to Save the Children?","yes I would be honored to. Since I am a nursing student and paying for tuition out of pocket, my donation amount may not be too great but I would like to donate something. So I like to donate $5 to the cause","Wow thats great but for the sake of formality, I must ask the obligatory legal fashion: \"How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

Have you ever heard of the charity Save the Children?","I have not. What do they do?","Save the Children is a great charity that provides education, healthcare, and advocacy to children in need in the U.S. and all over the world. Does this sound like a good charity to you?","It does. Children are one of the worlds most important assets. ","I think so too! Do you believe that children in need deserve help from others?","Yes. Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves. They have no choice but to rely on others. ","That's great that you care so much about children's needs! Save the Children is an exceptional charity in that over 86% of the donations go directly to children's programs all over the world. Have you donated to a charity before?","Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.","Those are great causes also. You mentioned earlier that you believe children to be one of the world's most important assets. Would you be willing to donate your earnings from this task to Save the Children?","I would if I had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support. ","Save the Children make the programs they support and the percentage of funding for each one available on their website. They are very transparent! Some of the causes they support include Emergencies (38%), Health and Nutrition (36%), and Education to more than 136 thousand children all over the world. The researchers curating this task collect the earnings from those who donate and send them directly to Save the Children. How much of your earnings would you be willing to donate?","I don't make a lot. I would have donate a smaller amount. Like a one time donation of 100$ or so. ","That's great! And any amount will go directly to benefiting children. However in this case I'm only asking about your earnings from this particular task :) . The full amount would be 30 cents.","I guess so ","Great! Thank you for your donation and for supporting children in need. Hope you have a great day!","And you too. "],"reward":0.3},{"conversation":["Hello!","Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?   ","Yes, I absolutely have. Save the Children is a great organization. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.","I have not heard of Save the Children before.   Sounds like they really help education wise.","They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. ","Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.  Oh so they do more than just help with education.  Thats awesome!!  ","Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. ","I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.  WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.","I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. ","It sure does.  ANything else I should know about this charity?","It is a huge movement. They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. ","WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.   SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?","Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! These kids really deserve it :)","I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.","You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. ","Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.   So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?  Do i pay online or how do I go about it?","Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There's no paying online or entering payment info. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)","Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?","I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.","I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?","yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.","It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?","I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.","I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?","Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. ","I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? ","Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.","I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  ","I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.","I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?","Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything. Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child. ","I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time","Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to. I have seen a lot of people do the same. I think some people will say \"maybe next time\" if they aren\\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and\/or they don\\'t have the funds to do so. When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy. ","This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children. The research team collects all the donations people elect to give and send them to save the children to help support the work that they do globally.  Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment?","Yes I would. I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.

How are you?","I am fine thank. are you interested in donating?","Im a perfect world where I had all the resources and money I could stand, I would love to be a philanthropist. I think childrens charities are a worthy cause. But, I do not work and I seldom donate due to the needs of our family.  I do like Childrens healthcare of Atlanta as a charity. What about you? which charity are you passionate about?","I used to donate here and there, but since I\\'ve started working on MTurk, I donated few charities though HITs. Have you heard about \"Save the Children\" charity?","Yes, I hear they feed starving children all over the world. Really sad situation. I couldn't imagine not being able to supply food for my kids. Heart breaking. I just read about a charity called The Project Linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children. All my kids love their security blankets. Do you have any kids?","No i do not have any kids, but I have a soft heart for kids. I like how \"Save the Children\" works on health and educational issues in 120 countries.","There is a good time and place for vaccines. Save the Children do help with vaccines as well as food. Crazy how 30.00 a month can change a child's future.  Another charity I read about is Reach Out and Read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading. I never heard of them before today, have you?","No I haven't heard. It is so good that you know a lot about children's charity. a little help can make a big difference, sometimes a family can live with just $30.00 per month","Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything. It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity. It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world. Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world. There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities. ","You have a lot of knowledge, thanks for sharing. I like the organization that are transparent with their financial reports, specially the ones that collaborate with big companies.","Yea, I think thats most important. There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need. I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities. Make a Wish Foundation is a good one, have you heard of them?","No not really, I know a little about different charities. I just donate here and there. I will save the ones you mentioned and will definitely search about them. I like how these HITs give the opportunity to talk about charities","Ive had a few of the charity HITs. I like to learn about an array of different things. I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs. Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here. I have a cousin who works with MercyShip. They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.","That is awesome. I have donated to organization that works on some disease through MTurk, like Malaria ","I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?","yes I did it before. Actually it breaks my heart to see children in pain. I think It is good to know donating through this task won't hurt your reward","Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities. I cant even imagine what these poor families go through. McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay. Ronald McDonald House is the name I think. ","I will look for it for sure. I like it when part of my purchase will be donated. Thank you for all the information","It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities. I think this is the last chat exchange.

Your donation will go towards helping the fight for children's rights to health, education, safety and so on. I'm asking you to donate your entire task payment to this foundation.","What countries would my donation be helping?","Many different countries, especially war zones... One that hits close to home for me is Syria. Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your small donation could help at least one of these children live a life without fear.","Okay I am interested but I wouldn't want to donate my entire task payment. Can I donate another amount?","The whole task amount isn't much to us but would be so much to them but I understand. How much of it would you be willing to donate?","0.15 half of my payment. I have a family to provide for and any little bit helps. But I also would like to help others.","Wow that's awesome. I totally understand about having to support a family too. I love the idea of helping others also, any little way that I can.","Is there anything else I should know about the charity?","Something I found pretty cool is Save The Children actually helped children fully recover in Texas after Hurricane Harvey. I like the idea that they are worldwide.","Wow they really have a far reach. That is wonderful what they are doing for our world.","Yes it is. They are a huge advocate to children. They believe that children make up 20% of our population but are 100% of our future and I couldn't agree more.","Children truly are our future. We need to care for them as we will need them in our old age.","Yes, your donation will go to help one of millions of children.

Are you a sponsor?","Honestly, I am not. But after doing this task and reading up on the website I am going to sign up. I love to do charity work. I also do alot of local volunteer work. Any way I can help a defenseless child I will. I always place my own child in their shoes.

But I bet this 2 dollars will go a long way to helping those kids.  Every little bit counts!","Yeah, two dollars doesnt seem like much to us, but its probably a huge help for children in poverty","It's horrifying to think about what those kids have been through.  I can't begin to imagine how they must feel right now.  It's not fair they are dealing with their situation at that age when all I was worrying about was who was the most popular kid in class.","I agree. Its hard to even think about living in a place that's violent, impoverished and where every day is difficult. It does make our problems seem pretty trivial","I stubbed my toe this morning and thought it was the worst thing ever.  Now, I don't feel that it was all that bad","haha yeah really! I hope other people doing this study decide to donate all of their money too. That would be a lot of help!","Seriously!  It'd be really neat to be able to see how many people donated to the cause","Agreed. Some researchers do send that info out after their studies (maybe they'll see our convo and do it!).

I have not heard of this organization","Well let me tell you about it! ","Yes, please, what does it focus on?","Save the Children is a non-governmental organization that operates world-wide fighting for children's rights and helps those children in developing countries. ","That is an important issue to address. How does the organization achieve this?","The organization collects donations that help to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.  The organization was able to help 155 million children in 2017, including 237,000 in the United States. ","Very good, does it partner with institutions or other organizations to be able to achieve this?","Yes, Save the Children has partnered with nearly 100 corporations, including Facebook Inc., TJMaxx, IKEA, Johnson & Johnson, TOMs, Carters Inc., Google, and other big names.  ","I am glad big companies are taking part on this. Do these corporations donate money, goods, or volunteer time?","Some corporations, like TJMaxx help out through large amounts of funding, or they contribute in other ways. For example, TOMS has an ongoing program that donates a pair of TOMS to children in need for every pair sold and Accenture works with them to explore technologies to help survive, learn, and be protected. ","That's very fitting to those brands and their own focus\/expertise. Is Save the Children actively looking for more corporations to help, or is it established with the present ones?","Save the Children is always accepting additional help. Save the Children also accepts help from those who wish to sponsor a child, host a fundraiser, participating in events, advocating for children, or by simply donating on their website.","I am glad there are so many options. Does this help come from people living in the United States only? ","There is also a Save the Children website specifically for those in the U.K. who are willing to help as well!","Great, it is a worldwide issue. How long has this organization been in existence? ","It was founded in 1919 and actually began in London before going global!","Oh, very interesting! it says a lot that it will be in existence for a century next year! does that mean there might be a special program to celebrate that achievement?","I wouldn't rule it out just yet. But there are a few triathalon's scheduled for 2019!  Are you interested in donating to support the cause?  9 out of every 10 dollars goes directly to a child in need.","Excellent, it should be celebrated! Yes, I will donate $1","Great!

Kind of goes without saying I suppose :) Is there a reason you don't currently donate to this charity?","I help support my own grandchildren whose parents are having a lot of difficulty in the current economy. I have also experienced a significant loss of income, thus working on Mturk to make ends meet.","That's very awesome of you and I am sorry to hear of your recent loss of income. I understand needing MTurk for supplemental income as our family is single income right now and sometimes its rough living paycheck to paycheck! I think that is why this opportunity is so unique today.

The busier season is starting as the colleges in the US will be started\/starting soon so that helps","So obviously it's worth it for you.

I do some at my work on days when its slow but mostly just in my off time instead of going on social media or something I come here","I guess it's a lot better way to waste time than seeing what a bunch of people I don't really care about are doing.  So when college is in there's less competition?  ","Haha exactly! When college is in session we get more studies\/surveys posted as a lot of the work on Turk is done for academic reasons.

They have all the grant money to throw out too.  So how much time do you throw at this in a given week?","It varies but generally a few hours on my workdays and maybe like 6 or 8 on my days off I'd say","That's pretty good.  I don't have that kind of time.  Any suggestions for a newcomer?","On the task page sort so you see the newest HITs, and grab whatever looks good to you as far as surveys. I'd recommend being wary of doing multiple HITs for any 1 requestor until you vet them yourself because rejections early on in a Turk account can make getting better hits tough (a lot of the better hits require 99% or higher approval rating) - and remember you'll get a lot faster at it as you keep going, it can feel a bit slow and tough at the beginning but it does get better","Thanks, the last few days have been pretty boring, I was hoping to see more progress.  Are sureveys the way to go?  I've seen a lot of the website searching stuff too?  Is that stuff worth it?","Website searching can be good, it never hurts to try a HIT once - see how fast you can complete it and decide if it\\'s worth doing more from there. One other cool thing about MTurk is that some studies allow you to donate money to a charitable cause directly from the task payment - This one we\\'re doing now in fact allows us to donate towards a foundation called \"Save the Children\"","Oh really?

","It will tell you in a short blurb above the box to donate (I've done this HIT before in the past) and the researchers ensure 100% of any amount you donate goes to the kids. Even a small donation makes a big difference because there are so many of us making small amounts that it really adds up!","That's great.  Certainly something that needs to be done.

All children do not have someone that cares about them and makes sure that they are taken care of.","The lack of help to children around the world has been very tramatic.  In the first two months of 2018, 1,000 children in Syria were reported killed or injured.  Your donation can help address these problems.","That is so sad.  Innocent children having their lives taken from them for no reason at all and others having to fight for their lives.  I would make a donation.","Save the Children is a professional and longstanding organization that has a record of helping children around the world.","I feel that we need more organizations like this one.  All children need a chance to be a child and not to be rushed into being an adult at a young age.","The money that you spend on stuff like a bag of candy can be used to help feed and protect children.

They have apparently done work recently to help children in Syria impacted by the civil war.  ","Do you know how long they've been around?","I don't see any exact date.  However, they have done work to improve access to education, medicine, and food in Darfur and appear to have been working when that area was also impacted by civil war.  ","Thanks, what are your contribution plans?","I am debating between 50% and all of the bonus.  So between 1 and 2 dollars.  I think even $1 can make a difference in their efforts.  What about you?","I'm thinking about the same","I think that seems fair.  From the description, they seem to have a pretty low overhead so even $1 will go directly toward the charitable efforts.  They've also apparently been involved in Jimmy Carter's organization that seeks to give kids and families clean water by getting rid of the guinea worm.  The water filters they use only cost $.90","Thanks for those details, I'd give a dollar to help.","Sounds like a good plan. So that $1 will be deducted from the payment.

I hope that you are having a great day so far!","good morning, yes i am... i hope you are as well","Indeed I am :) would it be alright with you if I spoke to you a little bit about a wonderful charity called Save The Children?","Absolutely, I am a little familiar with that orginization....","Thats great! Save The Children is a charity program that helps millions of children across the world. We provide numerous support groups and programs to help children everywhere. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. We provide protection to children and emotional support to them.","wow.... My career is working with the homeless... i am thankful that we dont have to factor protection from real bodily harm into our work. Save the Children truly is a good cause","That is amazing :) I have several friends and family that work together in my area to provide support for children and women against domestic violence. And to be able to speak to someone about the Save The Children Foundation is an honor. Across the US one in five children grows up in poverty. We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America. The best program we offer in my opinion is Education and our programs to help children grieve and obtain the emotional support they need in order to grow.","So Save The Children is 86 years old... that's incredible... a tremendous ammount of good has been done in all those years.... just out of curiosity, what is the percentage of donations that actually get to the need? i mean how much of every dollar is used for the actual program?","Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I am more than happy to provide information about our cause. 86% of our funding goes to  Program Services, 9% goes into fundraising meaning we get the word out about the charity and set up events. And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.  URL s\/about-us\/financial-information","Please dont misunderstand... i think you are a little low though.... i think more like 88.3% goes to your programs which is an incredibly great amount by comparison... like i said, I also work in Charity so its very interesting to me","PERSON_1: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: Our 86% was based off our 2017 annual report, I am sure there could be even more of a percentage as of late. Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world. That the world is not always cruel and that you can pull yourself from the ground up to the sky if you really want to. ","I Completely agree.... and after all... we have to take care of our children because they are our future","I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future. Every childs life matters, and where we are not forced to help those that need it, a lot of people still find the compassion to see that even a little amount of money can go a long way in helping those around us less fortunate.","you are absolutely correct... if a lot of people donate a little.... its still an astounding amount","So based off our discussion would you be interested in donating to the charity now? Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.","I do not have a problem with that at all, as a matter of fact... i've been waiting for you to ask... hahaha","Thats great! I would much rather give someone facts and accurate\/detailed information about a cause or charity before asking for anything from said person. So that depending on what you like and what you hear you can make the decision yourself on what you feel would be a good donation. For I cannot decide how much you donate to the cause, but rather what I myself can donate. Do you have a figure in mind?","I do, I was thinking Half of my payment which would be a total donation of $1","Thank you so much!

It promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.","What kind of countries? and What types of actions you make for the childrens?","Developing countries are places where the government isn't as strong, and many people live in poverty, so lots of things go unchecked that would be taken care of in more developed countries. It's important to have an independent organization look out for kids in those countries. Children are routinely treated in ways that are very bad in developing countries.","that sounds terrible, and how you help them been in other country?","We give them medical checkups. Many children in those countries have no routine access to healthcare, so they suffer from diseases like vitamin deficiency. We also help shine the light on abuse to help get them out of abusive situations.","That sounds very good, I've a friend that is from a foreign country and they're in a bad situation in that place, so I think it's very important to help them in anyway we can","Yes. Recently Save the Children helped rescue a child who was dying from hunger in one such country. They also helped relocate many children who were orphaned by Syrian Civil War. Many tragic things happen but Save the Children helps children when no one else seems to care or be capable.","Save the Children sounds amazing, so, please let me know, it's there anyway one can contribute or participate for the cause?","Yes, you can.

I'd say it's one of the most legit charities out there. They regularly make sure that the whole organization is audited. You can see where all the money goes in their reports.

In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.","That's pretty impressive! Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.","We do it for them, not for ourselves. And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.","I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.","That is very kind! After this chat is complete, you may choose how ever much you wish to give on the next page. Would you like to know about a potential child this money would be helping?","Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.","Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher. It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old. But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.","How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?","As you can see, $1 will change their world. One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about. Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people. This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.","Besides donating and raising awareness, is there any other way I can help Save the Children?","Yes. You can slo sign up & stay connected on our website with your email and phone number. You can also volunteer if you're in the area of any of these children at our program centers.

But, about a month ago I donated to St Jude for the purpose of entering in a raffle to win a house. The ticket was $100.","Those are a great way to give and also be able to receive yourself.  St Jude is a great foundation.  Have you ever heard of Save the Children charity?","Yes, I have. I believe it's a charity that focuses on aiding children in impoverished foreign lands.","Yes that is correct.  Are you aware about what is going on in Syria recently?","If by what is going on Syria you mean the civil war, yes. I'm not too informed on the details, but my assumption, based on what I've seen on the news is that Bashar Al-Asad wants to maintain his position of power while the rebels are trying to overthrow him.","It is unfortunate what is happening there. There has been a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

","Have you donated to the charity?","Not yet, it is something I am interested in doing though. Education is something that is really important to me and that is something that they help with. I think every child should have access to edcuation, especially in developing countries so that they can help improve their living situations. ","Yes, I agree, did you grow up with the proper resources?","I went through the public education system, it was one of the better school districts at the time. What about you? Is a lack of education something you faced?","I went to private Catholic school until I was 13, then I went to Public schools which was a much better experience","So you were able to have a good education experience as well. Isn't that something you would like to help other children receive? Anything from $0.01 to $2.00 or any amount you choose, it can go to helping them get an education.

You can just skip that next impulse purchase to help out. Save the Children does help more than education as well. They help ensure children's access to health care (which we know is a huge topic of discussion every where),and help improve their safety and well being. Many kids do not have access to safe living conditions to even make it to school each day. ","I usually donate to animal shelters,where do you donate ?","What ever charity my grocery store is supporting at the time. Typically children related, sometimes it is for others. It is easy to just add a couple cents on top of my purchase (round up the total) to help their cause. ","yes, that is true I do that often at stores, how did you hear about Save the Children?","I was directly contacted by the research team to help get donations for this amazing cause. Helping indirectly is one thing (like through the store) but actually giving when you can be a direct part is so much better. Wouldn't you like to give just $0.50 to this cause?

How was your weekend?","It was relaxing. Sometimes we plan busy weekends but this weekend we stayed home and relaxed. I've actually been reading about Save the Children. Are you familiar with the organization?","Yes I am. It is a very great organization and I believe it was founded by two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The organization is charity for the children who have been displaced by either hurricanes or other natural disasters and the charity steps in to help those children and families in need. ","Yes. I've always thought it was a worthwhile organization. I think we are all responsible in some way for taking care of the children of the world in whatever way we can.","That is very true because the way that I see it we are all one big family and should be there for one another in a time of crisis and distress.","Yes! I couldn't agree more. We are all in this together. Who knows what we can accomplish if we all do what we can for one another. ","Yes. We can accomplish big things if we care for one another and it shouldn't matter what party we are in whether its Democrat, Republican or Green it shouldn't matter. We are all Americans and we are one family. ","Once again, I couldn't agree more. I was just reading Save the Children is working in Syria. I'm sad to say, they are reporting over 1000 children have died in 2018 in the war. It's horrific to think of children having to live with this sort of fear. ","That is both terrible and sad to hear. Syria has a dictatorship and and someone who is obsessed with power. This is a bad combination because a lot of people and especially the most vulnerable like children are getting caught in the crossfire. Its very sad.","It is sad. I'm thinking about sending them a donation. I don't have much of a budget but I suppose every little be helps. If the millions of people just in the US alone contributed $1, that would be quite an infusion of money for Save the Children. ","That is correct.

Have you ever heard of Save the Children?","No, I have not heard of save the children. What is that? ","Save the Children is an organization that helps children all around the world that are in need. Where are you from?","That sounds like a nice organization! Do you know who founded the organization? I am from the United States. ","The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice. Today they work to help in health, education, protection, hunger and livelihood, crisis management, and advocacy for children around the world. Which of those sounds the most interesting?","Wow, I did not know that they did so much for the children! I honestly am not sure which is the most interesting because honestly they are doing so much goodness in the world. I love that they are making a difference in the young generation. It's interesting that it started during WWI and is still going today. Where are you from ? ","I am also from the United States, in South Carolina. I live in a rural town and many of the families around here are poor and have been poor for a long time. One of the major reasons for poverty is a lack of education, even from a very young age. Do you have any interest in doing your part to help out these children to help them rise from poverty?","SC is beautiful, although I have never been there.  I agree that lack of education can cause poverty, and it is a sad thing. Do you think it is hard for certain groups to get out of the poverty line? To me it seems when individuals are born into poverty because parents lack of education, thus leading to their own, it is kind of like a circle. do you believe this as well? I am interested in how I can help these children.","Yes exactly! In America, more than 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. In rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Save Our Children reached 638,000 kids 2016 through their programs! This is a good start, and you can help to do more. In this HIT, you are able to donate a portion of your $2 earnings to save the children. The researchers will collect the donations from the chat-logs and send them to Save the Children! Would you like to hear more about the education programs or any other programs before you decide how much to donate?","Wow, I did not even know the specifics of that statistic. I am wondering how much of my donation would go directly to the program, as I know that there are some sketchy organizations out there that pocket the money. Would my donation be split up between different areas of the organization, like some going to education, others to food drives, etc? ","Save or Children is actually one of the good ones! Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest? Save our Children uses it to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. The funds would be split to different programs they run that support the mission. Should I tell you about some other programs in the mission?","Yeah, I would like to hear about the programs, what are some of them? ","One example is Syria. After 7 years of war, Syria is now the #1 most dangerous country to be a child. \"There is no food and we can\\'t go outside. the planes are bombing,\" says a terrified child. \"One of my friends died in front of me - and I saw the blood,\" cries another. According to a boy in besieged Eastern Ghouta, \"It feels like the end of the world.\" Save the Children provides lifesaving services and supplies. They tend to children\\'s physical and psychological needs and set up places for children in crisis to learn and play.","Yes, I know about the atrocities happening in Syria right now, and how much it is affecting the children. I honestly can't even imagine going through that, let alone as a child. Even though I myself am not syrian, or know any syrians, it makes me eternally grateful that there are services going to the mental well-being of the children and that is even being considered, because I feel like mental issues tend to get pushed aside. ","Yes and you can help for less than the price of a cup of coffee! Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, Save the Children has helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children. This is just one of the many amazing programs that Save the Children does around the world. Do you think you would like to make a donation today?","Okay one last question, where does the other 10% go, if 90% goes to the actual organization? ","Well it all goes to the organization, the way that they use the money about 90% goes to funding programs in rural America, Syria, etc...and 10% goes to the running costs of events, administrative costs, etc... which also - even if a little indirectly - help further their mission. How much would you like to give? You can give any amount up to $2 out of your HIT reward","I am going to give .50 out of my $2. I hope you understand. ","Ok thank you for your donation of $0.50!

Most of what I know about them comes from reading about them online.","What countries do they help in?","They help children in 120 different countries, including the USA and most African, South American, and Asian countries.","Are donations made securely and safely?","They are. Save the Children is a very highly rated charity, rated 88.3 out of 100 by Charity Navigator in 2016. They also disclose all of their financial information online, to promote transparency in how they spend the money donated to them.","How much of the donation goes to the child?","86% of donations go into programs to help children. Administrative costs are only about 5% of donations, with the remainder going towards fundraising efforts.","Is that a good amount? How much can I donate?","5% is a rather low administrative cost for a charity, which is good. And the portion that goes to fundraising generates more donations than the money put into it, so it overall increases the money that gets to those who need it. And any donation helps, even something as low as one or two dollars.","What can one to two dollars buy for a child in need?","It depends of course on the region where the child being helped is located. But in some of the poorer parts of the world, a dollar can buy a few days worth of healthy food, or buy an item of clothing for a child who needs it.","Can I donate one dollar?","Yes, a 1 dollar donation is perfectly acceptable, and greatly appreciated.","I want to donate one dollar.","Excelent! Thank you very much for your donation."],"reward":1.0},{"conversation":["Hey, have you heard about Save the Children?","the charity right?","Yeah. Pretty much what they do is use donations from charitable, and caring citizens to help children around the world get on a better path to the future.","Oh. Well I think that the donations that go there are supporting a good cause. Especially for hungry children without food and water","So true. On top of that, they have full financial disclosure of their donations. About 86% goes to program services for less-fortunate kids, and the 14% goes to Fundraising and Management (Personally, I'd like to the latter number go down in the future).","Do you think too many people are donating to their charity? Why say that when they are being helped?","Not exactly. Just like any charity, they need to get money for operating costs, so not every single cent goes to the children unfortunatley. But 86% is a lot compared to other organizations.","Ah i see. So like for administration. I just read an article saying that not all donations are going to the right children; specifically to the less unfortunate. Would you ever consider donating to them knowing these facts?","It depends to be honest. You've got to understand that the organization needs money to stay operating, or else they would fail and no children would be helped. Make sense?","I understand that. I don't disagree with anything they do since children are being helped","That's true, have you donated to a charity before?","no not that i remember of","I didn\\'t before either, but recently I\\'ve been giving little bits here and there when I can. I think of it like... \"What would make me happier? A $1 cup of coffee or using that $1 to help someone in need.\" It truly is a rewarding experience.","hmm I'd love to donate if I was in a financially secure, but at the moment I don't think I can even spare a dollar. I do support all the donations going to the charity though.","Trust me, I understand haha. I'm in the same situation. But if you had the opportunity now to donate a $1 to Save the Children, you wouldn't? It'd be deducted from the task payment today. If that's too much even $0.50 will help out the children that really need. And hey, maybe someday those kids grow up to be some of the most generous, caring people in the world.","If its from today I guess I wouldn't mind.","Yeah, it's kind of like money that's not in your pocket yet haha. So, to be fair, I'll let you decide the amount of today's payment (0-$2) that gets donated, since you'll be the one making a difference.","Yeah. I'll go ahead and go with $0.50. Every penny counts. In the future, I would like to donate much more, its one of the promises I've made to myself","That's awesome! We need more people like you. Would you like me to provide you with some more information about Save The Children (just the link)?

It is interesting that your daughter is going to school for nursing. Do you think that it's because she has spent her life watching (and I'd assume participating in the) care of her brother?","Yes, that is exactly what she said was the reason she got into nursing! She has been his right hand since she was born. She knows more about him than i do. :)","Wow! You must be very proud of her! ","Yes I am. I know you are proud of your daughters.

I honestly don't know where she got it from! But, I am happy that at least someone in the family can make us look good. Haha  And yes, they are all so good with little ones. It does make me feel good to see that. I feel like I must have done some good things right as a mom, if they like kids so much!","Yes indeed! Some people are not as fortunate to have parents such as us. But I think that I did pretty good myself! My son did learn some living skills and learning more and my daughter is in school. ","I am sure you have done a great job with both of your kids! It sounds like they are very special!  I didn't design it this way, but I am glad that we talked about our kids so much.

That's important to me in a charity.","Yes, definitely. Unfortunately some \"charities\" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.","That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV\/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.

That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.","Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.","Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.

We try to actually know people involved before we give regularly.","That\\'s awesome and such an important step. Have you ever heard of \"Save the Children\"? I worked with them in Greece; they operate in refugee camps and other high-risk zones to address specifically the needs of kids","I have heard of them.  They sounds like a great charity from what I know.  We do something similar by sponsoring a child from an Ethiopian orphanage we visited.  What was your experience being in Greece like?  I don't think of it as being high risk...","Actually, many Greek refugee camps are rated as as-bad or worse than many camps in war zones. It's complete chaos, overrun by gangs and gang violence, and often lacking in basic hygiene and access to clean water or food. Women are frequently raped while trying to use the toilets (which are horrendous) and rats run amok among the tents. One of the children we were working with had a huge rat bite on her foot and many of them had fled to Greece on their own. ","Wow!  Did you feel safe?  What could you do to help?  ","It was nuts - we even had a neo-Nazi mob hunting us in the streets one night. I definitely did not feel safe there. We tried to do our best to get kids registered and provide English classes and some amount of regularity for them. Save the Children created a space just for kids and mothers and were able to assist with getting them into school","What an amazing experience!  That kind of thing shapes your life!  ","Well, yeah, but it's much more important to address the things shaping the lives of these children. That's why I think it's so important to donate to Save the Children. Even if we can't always be there, they are making the effort everyday","Do you still keep in touch with people over there?  Do you donate directly?","I do donate directly, not just to Save the Children, but to several other organizations as well. I still have friends working over there. This HIT we're doing has offered to donate some of our income to the charity. I always take MTurk requesters up on it when they ask us to donate our earnings. I mean, other people can use the $2 more than me, right? ","For sure!  Our money can do a long way!  I can donate my 30 cents!","Hey, that's awesome! Actually you're allowed to donate anywhere from $0-$2, not just your 30 cents! It's completely up to you. Once we decide to donate then they'll send the payment to Save the Children","I'll do 30 cents.  We actually give over 25% of our income away, but that's because we research and really KNOW the organizations.  I don't have a personal connection to Save the Children, like I do with the child in Ethiopia.","Absolutely! There are so many organizations around the world these days it's hard to know which one is the best. Do you know the website charitynavigator.org?

I'm sure it's a great website.  Is that how you got plugged in with Save the Children?","Oh, no, that's just one I use if someone is recommended a charity to me.
