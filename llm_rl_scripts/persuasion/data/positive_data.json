Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested?","I am already making a difference in many children lives.","That's great, it sounds like it's an issue you really care about then, why not put some of that effort into a charity that's doing really great work like Save the Children?","I have donated 15 years of my life to charity","I'm not asking you to donate years of your life, just a couple of cents if possible, is that something you could possibly do tonight?","No thank you","You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world?","No thank you","Do you have children yourself?

What they need is to be extracted from those countries so that they can have a better life not 0.25.","Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge. I understand it may not seem like a lot, but it can really make a difference. You can donate some or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children, i'd really appreciate it if you did, but I understand if you still don't want to. What do you say?

For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations.","I think this is quite interesting. I have read that 86% of the funds raised go directly to benefiting the children. I also think it is very interesting that a woman is President & CEO. I think this is great because not to often are woman CEO's. This speaks volumes in my opinion to the donors.","You are correct. The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing!","I feel a know a good bit about charities. I am disappointed in the salaries of the CEO, Executive VP & VP. I think a half million dollars that the CEO is compensated is a bit much. These dollars could be used to help more children. ","You won't hear me argue with that, but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.","I agree that a qualified person is needed to run such a charity. I think my biggest concern when salaries get so high they lose focus of what the organization is needing to do. We all like money! I think that this organization is a very good organization and have competent people running it. There are so many children charities that you really have to study each one to be able to decide who you would want to make your donation to. Are you a donor of Save the Children charity?","Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others! ","Absolutely true of Save the Children. I always look at how many children have been helped and what they help the children with. I then look at the overall salaries of the organization (petty maybe) but I need to make sure in my heart that the money I donate is going to help children not the management, even though I know a portion goes to them. I am willing to make a donation to the great cause.","If it helps you, Charity Navigator gives them 3 out of 4 stars. As you probably know there are very few charities that have a 4 star rating. This is mainly due to overhead costs of the charities. That being said, you can be assured your money will be doing a lot of good in the world!","Absolutely. I use Charity Navigator when I decide to make donations. I think it is important for people to look at this when making a decision to donate to any organization.","I think that is very wise to do. Even if you are making a small donation, you want to be sure that it is being used to its fullest potential.","Yes. I think this is where some people are lacking in making donations to organizations who don't benefit the greater good. Knowledge is a key factor.","It is a shame that we live in a world where this is an issue, but I think if you make a donation to Save the Children, you can be assured your money will be used to the fullest extent.","I agree. I will be making a donation to Save the Children organization.","How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.","I would absolutely donate the whole amount from this survey. I feel confident that the money would be well spent.","Thank you so much. That is a truly nice thing to do and a perfect way to start the day!","Absolutely! Makes me feel confident that my day and the day of a child will be blessed!"],"reward":2.0},{"conversation":["Hi","I believe in donating to St Jude's Childrens hospital.","If you like donating to Childrens causes, would you consider donating some of your task money to Save the CHildren?

How much of the proceeds go towards overhead?","It's a trusted charity and all the money goes to helping children. Your donation will go right to children's health, safety and education. ","That's great! I'm more concerned about developing my own country though.","Sure, that's important too. But to me, I can't sleep at night knowing that some Syrian children are literally starving to death and I could have helped feed them for the cost of what I spent on coffee today.","That is a good point. Do you know anything about UNICEF? It appears they donate to Syrian children as well.","I don't know much about UNICEF because I typically only donate to Save the Children because I know that my money is going directly to helping the kids. ","UNICEF was started by the United Nations, I'd hope all of their money went towards directly helping kids with them too.","I don't know much about them. You never know with charities with government influence. Is the money really going to children or is it paying for the CEO's million dollar salary?","I've found out only 92% of funds go towards helping the children with UNICEF!","100% of the funds goes to kids with Save the Children.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.","I'd like to donate 10 cents.","Would you consider donating a dollar?

Do they help refugee children as well?","Yes, they do. They try to provide food and shelter as well as educational opportunities. They are also working to get kids back together with their families if they have been separated during a crisis.","Awesome. Have you had any personal involvement with this charity?","I have not. I was actually just wondering what I could do to help kids worldwide due to the things that are happening to immigrant children in this country, and I came across it.","I haven't really had any experience with charities like this either. I haven't had the opportunity or funds but haven't seeked it out either to be honest. I hope to have more opportunities in the future","Would you be interested in donating a small bit of your payment to the charity? ","Yes, I would be willing to.","What do you think was the most important factor that you considered when making that decision?","Probably just that I would like to help more and I'm getting a decent pay for this study","How much would you be interested in donating?","I'll donate $1.00","That sounds great.

Glad you would be willing to give them a donation too.","Is there a specific group of people this is going to help or is it just a general fund?","I know that you can sponsor a child but other than that it is a general fund that helps children all over the world. ","There seems to be almost constant suffering out there now. I have been watching what is happening to Venezuela and it is getting really horrible there ","Indeed that is why I think it is important to help out even if it is just giving a small amount of money.","I know that the charities can get like 10lbs of food from one dollar","How much do you think you will give right now since it can be directly deducted from the payment for this task.","I think I would be willing to give $1","I think it will be really helpful.","Well anything that is caring for someone else who is really suffering is good."],"reward":1.0},{"conversation":["looking for donations","Do you think it is important to donate to Children's CHarities?","I think its important for you to donate.","Why only me?

The researchers will collect all of these donations and send them to Save the Children and what a great way to start the day. Thank you on behalf of these kids.","Awesome. I am glad to help!

I can let you in on some details and questions you may have.","I would prefer to find a charity that assist either in the medical funding side of children's cancer or financial burden assistance to the families of children with cancer. I feel like we can have more of a direct impact on something. Do you know of any charities like that?","Unfortunately no. However, the charity does in fact help the children access basic necessities such as food and water to those impacted by natural disasters across the globe. So while not directly helping families financially they are relieving some burdens.","Okay, I'm already familiar with Save the Children, I just typically have concerns on where the money actually goes with them. But how much are you thinking we should donate?","Any amount will do, however it'll be extracted from the task payment. I'd say .15 cents from both of us should be fair. Also my mistake earlier, Save the Children apparently has had a childhood cancer treatment going on for a few years now.","Okay, I think .15 cents sounds fair. And good, that makes me feel a bit better. ","Thanks for the consideration. Is there anything else you'd like to know?","Do you know how long the organization has been around?","Around the year 1919 near World War I, founded by Eglantyne Jebb in London.","And do they have an estimated number of children they have helped?","157 million children approximately, as well as 56 million children receiving direct help.","How many countries?","120 countries including the US.

So I think we should both donate if given the option. Children are our future, and there are way too many out there that will never have a chance at a future because they're starving right now, or in unsafe environments. The impact of any money given will be much greater for the kids, than if we were to keep it ourselves.","I see and I agree with you. I've recently traveled to Cambodia and felt the urgency to help the children who are suffering from poverty.","Oh yeah then you know firsthand how sad it is! Have you ever heard of Save the Children? It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, and works in developing countries like Cambodia to helpsupport the children. ","No I have not. Can you tell me more about this organization?","Yeah absolutely! It's not a government organization, so in my opinion the funds are better spent than being wasted in the typical bureaucratic red tape and wasteful expenditures. This means that it's reliant on donations from the public though! They also provide relief for extremely vulnerable children. In addition to money and food relief that they provide, they also offer access to health and education that they otherwise would not. ","I see. What is your role with this charity?","Oh none, just a supporter. I'm a single mother, so any Good organizations hit close to home. Do you think this sounds like an organization you'd support?","Oh I see. If I were to donate, how would I pay?","Well actually you could donate without actually having to pay! Mturk is giving us a bonus, and we can choose to donate part of it right through Mturk! I think this is awesome, because too many organizations just care about getting the results that they're looking for (research). But at least this one is also doing some social good as well! Do you think you'd donate just $1 if it was given through Mturk like I mentioned?","That's really awesome! Yeah $1 sounds good to me but I don't know if this amount would be impactful as you mentioned a few conversations ago.","That's not true, every penny counts! And in other countries, money can go a lot farther. Just because of your $1, there's now a child that won't have to go without food today or tomorrow :) You should feel good about your contribution!","You're right! I guess I need to start donating more often too. And yes, I'll donate my $1.","Thank you! I can relate though, I often feel like I'm not doing enough.

Do you ever volunteer your time at any charities for kids?","I help out at the local Goodwill 2 or 3 times a year, and kids benefit from that so I would say yes.","That's good. I really enjoy helping kids, its rewarding to see things from their perspective. And refreshing.","I agree, kids give an honest view of the world and this can be very refreshing.

Is that okay?  To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?","I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.","I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.  If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.  ","I feel really torn about the crisis.  I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.  At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.","I actually didn't think of it like that.  I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.  This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead! I don't know if that's really okay to do though. ","I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked. I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call \"stupid\".  I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.  Sorry Im getting off topic.","No, that's relevant. Really relevant. It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.  I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.  If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.  The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.  You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.  ","With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.  My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.  SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.  I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!","I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.  I hope you have success  in your field. I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.  I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.","I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.  They are the weak ones in my eyes.","I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do? I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment. Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.","I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.  I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.","If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.  So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.  You want to match all our payment to Save the Children? Would that be okay? Or should we lock in your half payment?","I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.  I would lock into half.","Sure let's do it. I might donate a little more I don't know how to do that but, I think they deserve it, I'm convince by talking to you that people regardless of how they feel about refugees that they can still care about kids. ","I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!","Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.  I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.  But you're right it's a whole generation, that's A LOT of people.

"],"reward":0.3},{"conversation":["Hello!","Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?   ","Yes, I absolutely have. Save the Children is a great organization. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.","I have not heard of Save the Children before.   Sounds like they really help education wise.","They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. ","Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.  Oh so they do more than just help with education.  Thats awesome!!  ","Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. ","I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.  WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.","I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. ","It sure does.  ANything else I should know about this charity?","It is a huge movement. They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. ","WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.   SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?","Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! These kids really deserve it :)","I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.","You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. ","Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.   So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?  Do i pay online or how do I go about it?","Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There's no paying online or entering payment info. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)","Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.  YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.","You are AWESOME! How much of your payment would you like to donate today? As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)","I will donate 0.05 cents today.

Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?","I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.","I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?","yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.","It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?","I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.","I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?","Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. ","I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? ","Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.","I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  ","I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.","I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?","Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything. Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child. ","I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time","Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to. I have seen a lot of people do the same. I think some people will say \"maybe next time\" if they aren\\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and\/or they don\\'t have the funds to do so. When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy. ","This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children. The research team collects all the donations people elect to give and send them to save the children to help support the work that they do globally.  Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment?","Yes I would. I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.

I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water. If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.","Yes I agree. That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children. As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?","I sponsor through World Vision. I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going. You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community. And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general. It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.","I cannot thank you enough for that. How much do you donate on average annually?","Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually. I also send him little care packages every so often. At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc. That will have such a big impact on their lives.

How do you know the money I donate will reach them?","Ok, well out of all the money you donate, 86 percent goes to actually programs to help them (which is alot) 9 percent is rolled back in to fundraising and 5 percent is used for miscellaneous expenditures. These numbers are really good when compared to other charities","Oh yeah thats good. How does my money get to the charity from here?","The research team will collect all or any donations and send it to the Save the Children.

I cant guarantee where exactly the money will go, but where would you like to see it go?","I would hope it would go to food, water, clothing, or education for those children less fortunate thank my own.","Yes those would be great places to go. You know it will also go to children in places like Syria where 1000 have been reported killed or injured in 2018 alone. Sad stuff. ","I can't imagine how bad it is over there. It's tragic the amount of people and especially children that are dying.","Yes indeed, thats why organizations like Save the Children are so important in relief for these children. Are there any other questions on the donation?","Yes. I do not need to do anything further for the donation, right? ","No you will be prompted at the end by the research team and they will take care of the donation. Thank you again for making the donation you are a good person. ","Awesome!

What kind of work do they do with children?","They go into places where many other agencies won't go...war torn nations like Somalia, Venezuela and Syria. They specifically concentrate on helping children, who really are innocent and can't fend for themselves. Many of them are orphans.","That sounds like a pretty good cause. Are they a non-profit? Do you know how they are funded?","Yes they are definitely non-profit. They get donations from big donors like corporations, but a lot of their funding comes from people like you and me who give smaller amounts. Any little bit helps. When you consider that workers in many countries make $3.00 a day, just 50 cents can make a huge difference in the life of a child.","That's true. Every little bit counts, I suppose.","I usually am one who supports animal welfare charities and environmental charities, but Save the Children is one of the few children's charities that I really have a lot of respect for. I am going to donate some of my task money. I was wondering if you would be interested in doing the same. It doesn't have to be a lot...just what you feel moved to donate. Any bit makes a difference.","Oh i'm a big animal lover too! I'd definitely be interested in donating, but can I ask a few questions first?","Sure! I'll answer as best as I can.","Awesome. Do you know how much of our donations go directly to help the children? Sorry, to ask but I've contributed to a few that were less than open about it...","charity navigator says 88.3% which is in line with similar charities that do the same thing","Oh, that's actually pretty good.

I think we only get $0.30 for this HIT, so can I donate all or part of that?","You can donate anywhere from 0 to 30 cents. The decision is yours. And thank you for whatever you decide to give.

I actaully never knew that the BBB had such a thing to measure that sort of implication. I do know in fact that many NGO's out there do not use the money for the actual mission they are seeking.

Save the Children targets America's most isolated and underserved children. 20% of children in the US grows up in poverty; of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural, which is why rural America is a focus for this organization.

Save The Children is a charity program that helps millions of children across the world. We provide numerous support groups and programs to help children everywhere. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. We provide protection to children and emotional support to them.","wow.... My career is working with the homeless... i am thankful that we dont have to factor protection from real bodily harm into our work. Save the Children truly is a good cause","That is amazing :) I have several friends and family that work together in my area to provide support for children and women against domestic violence. And to be able to speak to someone about the Save The Children Foundation is an honor. Across the US one in five children grows up in poverty. We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America. The best program we offer in my opinion is Education and our programs to help children grieve and obtain the emotional support they need in order to grow.","So Save The Children is 86 years old... that's incredible... a tremendous ammount of good has been done in all those years.... just out of curiosity, what is the percentage of donations that actually get to the need? i mean how much of every dollar is used for the actual program?","Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I am more than happy to provide information about our cause. 86% of our funding goes to  Program Services, 9% goes into fundraising meaning we get the word out about the charity and set up events. And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.

Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world.

","I Completely agree.... and after all... we have to take care of our children because they are our future","I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future.

Save the Children supports nutrition, sanitation and education initiatives in the US and third world countries.","That sounds pretty good. I don't know why I've never heard of it. Doesn't sound like a charity someone could disagree with. Have they had any scandals or any thing? ","None that I am aware of.  I'm surprised you've never heard of it.

They've seen them on TV before.","Yes, hurricanes can be dreadful, tornadoes as well. Save the Children is an amazing charity that I'm collecting donations for today. I personally feel like it's our moral obligation to make sure that all children are well taken care of. Don't you agree?","I totally agree. They weren't asked to be put in the position in which they live and feel that people should do as much as they can if they are able to help anybody out.","You are so right! Sadly many children are subjected to violence or are living on the streets starving and sick. You said you had seen a commercial. What about it appealed to you?","Just showing the general public the conditions in which some have to live in. There's a lot of people that have no clue of how poor some countries are and the conditions in which people have to live in. ","That's one of the amazing things about Save the Children. We are a global charity, offering food, clean water, educational material, and vaccines to children that need it most. Our website offers much education to the public about living conditions and the negative things that affect these innocent children. ","That's awesome that they are global. What people don't realize about donation is that with some of them like Save the Children just a few pennies can do so much. There's people that don't donate just because they have no idea just how little it takes and where their money goes.","Exactly! Most people spend countless amounts of money on wasted product or food when something as small as $1.00 can benefit one of these children. Did you know that in the first two months of this year, 1,000 children were reported killed or injured in Syria. That's so heartbreaking and it angers me. How does it make you feel?","It upsets me a great deal. I think that it's hideous that these innocent people are being killed over most of the time generally hasnothing to do with them.

I believe I have heard of save the children. Is that the organization that prioritizes funding for children without homes?","Yes that is part of what they do, for instance the refugee crisis in Syria, this organization commits to saving these children from the daily threat of violence.  But that is just an example.","I actually work with some organizations that do similar work to this on a smaller more local scale.

If you ever heard the term, \"save a child for a cup of coffee\"  it came from them.","Definitely. And I am not doubting that they do good work I was just curious about how they allocate their donations. Going back to the United Way I mentioned earlier they actually let you decide where your donations get put to work. If you would like them to choose for you they have a community fund.","Oh I get that, I guess that will be in the hands of the researchers themselves.  I am sure save the children allows specific donations to go to specific needs, but you would be donating through a \"3rd party\" so to speak.  Would you like to contribute?","You said up to $2 but my payment for this is only $0.30 so I am not sure how this works","Oh, there is a bonus of $2 for completing this task, after we speak there will be a section where you can designate how much you would like to donate.","I see.

I couldn't agree more. We are all in this together. Who knows what we can accomplish if we all do what we can for one another. ","Yes. We can accomplish big things if we care for one another and it shouldn't matter what party we are in whether its Democrat, Republican or Green it shouldn't matter. We are all Americans and we are one family. ","Once again, I couldn't agree more. I was just reading Save the Children is working in Syria. I'm sad to say, they are reporting over 1000 children have died in 2018 in the war. It's horrific to think of children having to live with this sort of fear. ","That is both terrible and sad to hear. Syria has a dictatorship and and someone who is obsessed with power. This is a bad combination because a lot of people and especially the most vulnerable like children are getting caught in the crossfire. Its very sad.","It is sad. I'm thinking about sending them a donation. I don't have much of a budget but I suppose every little be helps. If the millions of people just in the US alone contributed $1, that would be quite an infusion of money for Save the Children. ","That is correct. If people in the US contribute $1 for Save the Children the world will be indeed a better place. I will do also give a donation. Children must never live in fear and in horrible conditions that they can't escape from.","According the researchers who's MTurk HIT I'm working on, you could donate right now through this HIT.

Have you ever heard of Save the Children?","No, I have not heard of save the children. What is that? ","Save the Children is an organization that helps children all around the world that are in need. Where are you from?","That sounds like a nice organization! Do you know who founded the organization? I am from the United States. ","The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice. Today they work to help in health, education, protection, hunger and livelihood, crisis management, and advocacy for children around the world. Which of those sounds the most interesting?","Wow, I did not know that they did so much for the children! I honestly am not sure which is the most interesting because honestly they are doing so much goodness in the world. I love that they are making a difference in the young generation. It's interesting that it started during WWI and is still going today. Where are you from ? ","I am also from the United States, in South Carolina. I live in a rural town and many of the families around here are poor and have been poor for a long time. One of the major reasons for poverty is a lack of education, even from a very young age. Do you have any interest in doing your part to help out these children to help them rise from poverty?","SC is beautiful, although I have never been there.  I agree that lack of education can cause poverty, and it is a sad thing. Do you think it is hard for certain groups to get out of the poverty line? To me it seems when individuals are born into poverty because parents lack of education, thus leading to their own, it is kind of like a circle. do you believe this as well? I am interested in how I can help these children.","Yes exactly! In America, more than 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. In rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Save Our Children reached 638,000 kids 2016 through their programs! This is a good start, and you can help to do more. In this HIT, you are able to donate a portion of your $2 earnings to save the children. The researchers will collect the donations from the chat-logs and send them to Save the Children! Would you like to hear more about the education programs or any other programs before you decide how much to donate?","Wow, I did not even know the specifics of that statistic. I am wondering how much of my donation would go directly to the program, as I know that there are some sketchy organizations out there that pocket the money. Would my donation be split up between different areas of the organization, like some going to education, others to food drives, etc? ","Save or Children is actually one of the good ones! Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest? Save our Children uses it to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. The funds would be split to different programs they run that support the mission. Should I tell you about some other programs in the mission?","Yeah, I would like to hear about the programs, what are some of them? ","One example is Syria. After 7 years of war, Syria is now the #1 most dangerous country to be a child. \"There is no food and we can\\'t go outside. the planes are bombing,\" says a terrified child. \"One of my friends died in front of me - and I saw the blood,\" cries another. According to a boy in besieged Eastern Ghouta, \"It feels like the end of the world.\" Save the Children provides lifesaving services and supplies. They tend to children\\'s physical and psychological needs and set up places for children in crisis to learn and play.","Yes, I know about the atrocities happening in Syria right now, and how much it is affecting the children. I honestly can't even imagine going through that, let alone as a child. Even though I myself am not syrian, or know any syrians, it makes me eternally grateful that there are services going to the mental well-being of the children and that is even being considered, because I feel like mental issues tend to get pushed aside. ","Yes and you can help for less than the price of a cup of coffee! Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, Save the Children has helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children. This is just one of the many amazing programs that Save the Children does around the world. Do you think you would like to make a donation today?","Okay one last question, where does the other 10% go, if 90% goes to the actual organization? ","Well it all goes to the organization, the way that they use the money about 90% goes to funding programs in rural America, Syria, etc...and 10% goes to the running costs of events, administrative costs, etc... which also - even if a little indirectly - help further their mission. How much would you like to give? You can give any amount up to $2 out of your HIT reward","I am going to give .50 out of my $2. I hope you understand. ","Ok thank you for your donation of $0.50!

Save the Children is a very highly rated charity, rated 88.3 out of 100 by Charity Navigator in 2016. They also disclose all of their financial information online, to promote transparency in how they spend the money donated to them.","How much of the donation goes to the child?","86% of donations go into programs to help children. Administrative costs are only about 5% of donations, with the remainder going towards fundraising efforts.","Is that a good amount?

I don't disagree with anything they do since children are being helped","That's true, have you donated to a charity before?","no not that i remember of","I didn\\'t before either, but recently I\\'ve been giving little bits here and there when I can.

I do support all the donations going to the charity though.","Trust me, I understand haha. I'm in the same situation. But if you had the opportunity now to donate a $1 to Save the Children, you wouldn't? It'd be deducted from the task payment today. If that's too much even $0.50 will help out the children that really need. And hey, maybe someday those kids grow up to be some of the most generous, caring people in the world.","If its from today I guess I wouldn't mind.","Yeah, it's kind of like money that's not in your pocket yet haha. So, to be fair, I'll let you decide the amount of today's payment (0-$2) that gets donated, since you'll be the one making a difference.","Yeah. I'll go ahead and go with $0.50. Every penny counts. In the future, I would like to donate much more, its one of the promises I've made to myself","That's awesome! We need more people like you.

Not nearly the level of autism of your son, but I do have empathy for you. ","Oh thank you so much. Me and my husband are very grateful that he is not as severe as some. He can pretty much understand everything you are saying and he can do many things for himself like eating, bathing, washing his clothes and many other things. It's just that the speech is not there. He started at 2 yrs. but it never developed.","It must be very hard, and also at the same time very rewarding, taking care of a child with special needs.  It is interesting that your daughter is going to school for nursing. Do you think that it's because she has spent her life watching (and I'd assume participating in the) care of her brother?","Yes, that is exactly what she said was the reason she got into nursing! She has been his right hand since she was born. She knows more about him than i do. :)","Wow! You must be very proud of her! ","Yes I am. I know you are proud of your daughters. What is your daughter going to college to do?","She graduated with a degree in Interior Design. She has been a designer since she was about 3 years old! LOL  My other girls, though, have no idea what they like, except that they all like taking care of children (all work in day care or nanny jobs).","That awesome! I always admire people who can visualize what is stylish for a room. I don't know a thing about decorating! And your other two sound like very compassionate and caring young ladies. You have to be to take care of little ones!","I am with you there! I have absolutely zero flair for style. But my daughter has always been able to put things together so well. I honestly don't know where she got it from! But, I am happy that at least someone in the family can make us look good. Haha  And yes, they are all so good with little ones. It does make me feel good to see that. I feel like I must have done some good things right as a mom, if they like kids so much!","Yes indeed! Some people are not as fortunate to have parents such as us. But I think that I did pretty good myself! My son did learn some living skills and learning more and my daughter is in school.

A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.  That's important to me in a charity.","Yes, definitely. Unfortunately some \"charities\" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.","That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV\/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.","That's very helpful. It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money. That way nobody can question anything.","Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.","Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.","Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?","Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child. The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.","That is so special.  That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.  How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?  You can choose an amount that would be taken out automatically from your reward from this task.  You can pick any amount from $0 to $2.

How are you today?","Hey I'm great! How are you today?","I'm well. Waiting for the summer heat to die down, though it's nicely dying, LOL. What part of the world are you in?","I hear that! I'm in Georgia, USA. It's super humid today. How about you?","Oh wow, I used to live in Atlanta. I'm in Pennsylvania. Yesterday was humid, and I still haven't stepped outside today. Still in the AC!","I'm originally from NYC. My friends back at home were telling me that it has been particularly hot these past few days. The temperature down here has been rather lower than usual, but the humidity is high!","Oh wow, I used to live in Jersey City, which is a ride away from NYC. So cool. I went to school there from nonprofit management, and ironically I'm working with a group called Save The Children. It's an org that provides basic assistance to children around the world with necessities needed to live. Ones we often take for granted in the states. We're currently seeking donations up to $2. Are you interested in giving back a bit of $$? It could do so much good in the life of a hungry, neglected, or abused child. ","I wish I could! For right now, this is my only source of income, and I have a 5 month old infant to feed. In the future, I will give back double, but for now he and I need all the help we can get.","Oh wow. Do you have a boy or a girl? I totally understand your position. Again, no amount is too small. One penny donated from your earnings could do a lot of good in the 3rd world. I'll match whatever you decide to give. I'm not floating in money either, but to me this is worth it. Let me know.","A little boy, my first. I will donate $.25. During our difficult time, I can still spare some money to help another. I can only hope that will help, and maybe we will have some good karma! His dad was working, but was in a car accident and now he's still in the hospital in Jacksonville, FL recovering.","Well total congrats to you on new mother! And thank you so much for your donation! I will of course match that $.25. I think $.50 from the both us us can go a long way. Every little bit counts. I believe in karma as well. Is the father of your child expected to recover soon and be released. That is so terrible. For anyone, but especially a new dad. You totally have my prayers and positive energy.","Thank you so much! I have found my calling in life and love being a mommy. I'm glad to help. Every little bit does count, and while I have downtime I do lots of online work to make a little bit of money. He will be in the hospital for the rest of September, he shattered his ankle in a car crash. He has epilepsy and had a breakthrough seizure. He is doing ok though, thank God, and thank you for your prayers and positive energy. ","I'm glad you found your calling. I work online and do on demand jobs as well. It started out due to illness, but I really like it. I like Turking, but I also like Microworkers, TextBroker (writing), and finding gigs on Upwork.com. Are there any good online work sites you'd recommend? I'm up for any job.","For now, I am just using Turk, but I have used other survey sites in the past. I get the best results and most consistent payments with Turking.","Oh so cool. When I was driving for uber last year, I drove a woman with epilepsy, who just began having seizures recently, and we were talking about remedies for her. I suggested the legal CBD oil as I began taking it for anxiety, and she said she would check it out. A lot of people have also been helped with legal marijuana, but I don't think that's available in GA. And that sucks.","Agreed. My husband is a strong supporter of CBD oil. He is trying to get approved for a medical marijuana card, because it helps him immensely.","Oh wow so cool. I know funds are low, but in the future are there any causes you feel strongly about that you would put your money behind?","Epilepsy and finding a cure, for sure.","Oh. Recently I've become interested in donating to people who are wrongfully incarcerated. I'd like to donate to their legal fees. Like you, I do believe in karma and goodness, but haven't really donated much. Matching your donation today makes me feel really good.","Well I'm glad that I was able to help today, even with a small amount.","Thank you so much, have a great day!

I like to get involved becaue I like to feel like I might be helping out in some way. I love helping out with animal groups and groups that help out disadvantaged children.

Would you ever consider donating to a charity like that?","I have heard of that group but I have never really thought about donating to it.","They're a great group, they're an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. I like to donate a little bit to them from time to time, not much mind you, I don't really have or make a lot of money, but it's nice knowing I can contribute at least a little something. Anything that can help. Sometimes it can really brighten my day knowing I might have helped someone. Would you consider making a small donation from a portion of the HIT completion compensation, something as little as .10 cents?","Yes, I can make a small donation. I will do $0.20.","That would be awesome! Anything from $0.10, $0.20, $2.00... anything would make a difference with this wonderful organization. Every contribution counts. You're helping make a difference in a child's life an helping to end suffering.

I ike doing some of theses surveys then hearing the results later on, passively, since I don\\'t really know at the time of doing them what they\\'re for really. It\\'s fun to say, \"Hey, I participated in that study\"","Yeah I like doing the Product review type HITs and the ones where you have to watch a video  ","Those are pretty good. My favorite one so far has been recording my voice saying various words for a study on accents in speech. Then hearing the results on a news story about 6 months later... pretty satisfying.","That sounds interesting.

We should be getting a lot of rain soon because of a tropical storm coming up","That is what we are getting now, you must be close to the Gulf of Mexico also.  Do you normally work online? I do.","I have a part-time job in the real world but I do some online stuff on the side. I'm actually in the northeast part of the country, but when there's a big storm down south we get some of the effects of it. But I hope it doesn't get too bad where you are, it seems like storms get worse and worse every year.","True, they are.  The climate change is due to people I feel.  Like not recycling properly, did you know that there is a giant plastic glob out in the ocean from people throwing away tons of plastic stuff?  It's sad.","Wow I didn't know that, that's pretty gross. Yeah climate change is pretty crazy. And people don't even realize the impact it has on human beings, like the weather and pollution is really affecting agriculture and making it harder to grow crops. And there's all the damage from storms of course, people still struggling months and months after hurricanes.","We were affected by hurricane Harvey and that took months to recover from.  I became Vegan about 2 years ago and since then, it has made me more aware of our environment and the care of animals. I did it for health reasons but it became more than just that for me.","Oh cool I'm vegan too actually. It was the same for me, I made the switch to reduce cancer risk since there's a lot of that in my family, but eventually it became an environmental\/animal rights thing. I've been vegan for about 6 years and was vegetarian for about 5 before that. I'm so sorry to hear hurricane Harvey affected you. Were there any government programs or non-profits that helped you to recover?","Yes, the government program actually helped us tremendously. I changed to a Vegan diet due to a Cancer risk as well, every woman but me in my family has had some type of cancer. I actually have converted my elderly mother to a Vegan diet over the last year, she's doing great!","Wow that's really great to hear! My parents won't go vegan or vegetarian themselves but have definitely started making healthier choices since I went vegan. I guess every little effort helps, right?

You can pick any amount and it will be deducted from your task payment.","I will donate 1.00 to Save the Children, which is half of my earnings.  Thank you!","That's really great, thank you! Can I ask how you first heard about Save the Children?","I think it was on television.  They did a like a 30 minute show to bring awareness to the Charity.  They are a very good charity.  I'm not able to conceive a child so I would love helping other people children in need.","Wow yeah, that's a really great way to pay it forward if you aren't able to have kids yourself.

I thought it was an interesting idea. Plus sometimes I\\'m just lazy and that\\'s an easy uncomplicated way to do it.","Yes, i do like that concept. However, I often wonder what a big difference it would really make","Remember that ice bucket challenge thing that was super popular a while back? I thought it was fun but wouldn't do anything productive. Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help.","Oh wow, I never knew that! That is amazing what a difference we can make without thinking it would really make one","I know and besides it got my son to dump a bucket of ice water on himself which was just hilarious.","That is funny! Honestly, before the challenge I never even heard about ALS, so I guess it did its job by spreading awareness","That's really true. Maybe on top of people not wanting the rigamarole of the donation process sometimes all we need is a better understanding of the need or just faith that a little from everyone can go a long way. ","Yea, maybe more challenges can be done to spread awareness to diseases that often go unnoticed or unheard of","Yeah, maybe, people just need information, ease of donating, and a sense of community about it all. This HIT we are doing is kind of doing the same thing as that other survey I did. We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away.

They sounds like a great charity from what I know.  We do something similar by sponsoring a child from an Ethiopian orphanage we visited.  What was your experience being in Greece like?  I don't think of it as being high risk...","Actually, many Greek refugee camps are rated as as-bad or worse than many camps in war zones. It's complete chaos, overrun by gangs and gang violence, and often lacking in basic hygiene and access to clean water or food. Women are frequently raped while trying to use the toilets (which are horrendous) and rats run amok among the tents. One of the children we were working with had a huge rat bite on her foot and many of them had fled to Greece on their own. ","Wow!  Did you feel safe?  What could you do to help?  ","It was nuts - we even had a neo-Nazi mob hunting us in the streets one night. I definitely did not feel safe there. We tried to do our best to get kids registered and provide English classes and some amount of regularity for them. Save the Children created a space just for kids and mothers and were able to assist with getting them into school","What an amazing experience!  That kind of thing shapes your life!  ","Well, yeah, but it's much more important to address the things shaping the lives of these children. That's why I think it's so important to donate to Save the Children. Even if we can't always be there, they are making the effort everyday","Do you still keep in touch with people over there?  Do you donate directly?","I do donate directly, not just to Save the Children, but to several other organizations as well. I still have friends working over there. This HIT we're doing has offered to donate some of our income to the charity. I always take MTurk requesters up on it when they ask us to donate our earnings.

Actually you're allowed to donate anywhere from $0-$2, not just your 30 cents! It's completely up to you. Once we decide to donate then they'll send the payment to Save the Children","I'll do 30 cents.  We actually give over 25% of our income away, but that's because we research and really KNOW the organizations.  I don't have a personal connection to Save the Children, like I do with the child in Ethiopia.","Absolutely! There are so many organizations around the world these days it's hard to know which one is the best. Do you know the website charitynavigator.org?

I'm sure it's a great website.  Is that how you got plugged in with Save the Children?","Oh, no, that's just one I use if someone is recommended a charity to me.
